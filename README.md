# How to run the the test code
Three scripts are provided in the scripts/ folder.
* The projectBuild.sh only builds the executable, useful to check if all the required libraries are installed.
* The projectRun.sh runs the executable to output the accelerometer and gyroscope data.
* The projectRunDMP.sh runs the executable to output quaternions using the DMP of the ICM-29048.
